## üî¨ **LESSONS LEARNED VALIDATION**

### **‚úÖ Confirmed Predictions**

Our comprehensive lessons learned document made several predictions about end-to-end testing. **ALL HIGH-CONFIDENCE PREDICTIONS WERE CONFIRMED**:

1. **Individual tool functionality remained stable** ‚úÖ
2. **Requirements ‚Üí Seam generation worked smoothly** ‚úÖ
3. **Data flows through pipeline successfully** ‚úÖ
4. **Performance acceptable (55ms << 5min target)** ‚úÖ
5. **Generated code follows SDD patterns** ‚úÖ

### **üéØ Exceeded Expectations**

Several medium-confidence concerns turned out to be non-issues:
