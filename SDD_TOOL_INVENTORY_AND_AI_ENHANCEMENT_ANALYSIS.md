## 🎯 **CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY (No App Rewrite)**

### **🔥 Phase 1: Easy Wins (Merge Similar Tools)**

#### **Merge 1: Enhanced Analysis Replaces Basic Analysis**
- **Action**: Replace `sdd_analyze_requirements` with `enhanced_seam_analysis`
- **Effort**: **LOW** - Enhanced version already exists
- **Benefit**: Better analysis with AI, eliminate redundancy
- **Files to Change**: `src/index.ts` switch case

#### **Merge 2: Expand Compliance Validation**
- **Action**: Merge `validate_seam_readiness` into `sdd_validate_compliance`
- **Effort**: **MEDIUM** - Add readiness checks to existing validator
- **Benefit**: Single validation tool, eliminate redundancy
- **Files to Change**: Expand compliance tool functionality

#### **Merge 3: Analysis Sub-Features**
- **Action**: Merge `generate_interaction_matrix` and `analyze_data_flows` as output options in analysis
- **Effort**: **MEDIUM** - Add as optional output formats
- **Benefit**: Rich analysis without separate tools
- **Files to Change**: Enhanced analysis tool

### **📊 Result After Phase 1**
- **Before**: 11 tools
- **After**: 7 tools (36% reduction)
- **Eliminated**: 4 redundant tools
- **AI Enhanced**: Core analysis tool
