/**
 * SDD MCP Server - NextGen ValidationEngine (AST-based, SDD-strict)
 *
 * ðŸŽ¯ PURPOSE: Enforce SDD compliance, contract/stub/test coverage, and blueprint documentation using AST-level analysis and granular reporting.
 *
 * SEAMS:
 * 1. File Discovery Seam: Find all contract, stub, and test files.
 * 2. AST Parsing Seam: Parse files into ASTs for precise analysis.
 * 3. Contract Analysis Seam: Enforce async, ContractResult<T>, and Blueprint comments on all contract methods.
 * 4. Stub Analysis Seam: Ensure every contract has a stub with NotImplementedError fail-fast logic.
 * 5. Test Analysis Seam: Ensure every contract/stub method is covered by a test (static and optionally runtime coverage).
 * 6. Blueprint Comment Seam: Require // Blueprint: comments for all SDD artifacts.
 * 7. Reporting Seam: Report all issues with file, line, column, code snippet, rule, and suggested fix.
 * 8. Error Handling Seam: Robust error capture and reporting.
 *
 * CONTRACT:
 * - Input: Validation request (project root, options)
 * - Output: Granular compliance report (per file, per rule, with locations and suggestions)
 *
 * NOTE: This is a stub/blueprint for Gemini to improve and implement.

/**
 * PROMPT FOR GEMINI:
 *
 * Gemini, please:
 * - Review and improve this stub/blueprint for a next-generation SDD validation engine.
 * - Implement AST-based contract/stub/test analysis, strict SDD enforcement, and granular reporting as described.
 * - Ensure all seams are modular and SDD-compliant.
 * - In addition to validating business contracts/stubs/tests, also validate the seams, contracts, and SDD compliance of all SDD tools themselves (stub generator, orchestrator, visualizer, compliance validator).
 * - Add any enhancements for performance, extensibility, or developer experience you recommend.
 * - Return a production-ready implementation.
