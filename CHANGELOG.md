## [1.0.0-alpha.2] - 2025-05-26

### ðŸŽ¯ MAJOR PIVOT: Adopted SDD for SDD Server Development

This release represents a fundamental shift from traditional development to using **SDD methodology to build the SDD MCP Server itself** - a perfect demonstration of "eating our own dog food"!

### Added - SDD Methodology Application

- **Requirements Document** (`docs/mcp-server-prd.md`)

  - Clear project vision and functional requirements
  - Technical and quality requirements definition
  - Success criteria and scope boundaries

- **Seam Analysis** (`docs/mcp-server-seam-analysis.md`)

  - Identified 6 critical seams in MCP server architecture
  - Defined seam dependencies and integration points
  - MCP Protocol, SDD Function, Template Processing, Validation, Error Handling, and Configuration seams

- **Contract Generation** (`src/contracts.ts`)

  - Type-safe interfaces for all 6 seams
  - ContractResult<T> pattern for consistent error handling
  - Zod schemas for runtime validation
  - Blueprint comments for implementation guidance
  - AgentId tracking for debugging and diagnostics

- **Implementation Stubs** (`src/stubs.ts`)

  - Ready-for-implementation skeletons for all agents
  - NotImplementedError patterns for progress tracking
  - Integration test templates for each seam
  - Comprehensive TODO comments with implementation hints
  - Health check framework

- **Implementation Strategy** (`docs/sdd-implementation-strategy.md`)
  - Phase-by-phase implementation plan
  - Priority order for agent development
  - Testing strategy using SDD principles
  - Benefits analysis of using SDD for SDD

### Changed - Architecture Improvements

- **Package Configuration**

  - Updated to `sdd-mcp-server` name
  - Added proper ES module support
  - Configured build scripts and binary distribution
  - Added TypeScript types for Node.js

- **TypeScript Configuration**
  - Modern ES2022 target with ESNext modules
  - Proper output directory structure
  - Source maps and declaration files
  - Optimized for MCP server deployment

### Benefits of SDD Approach

- **Clear Architecture**: Seam analysis revealed clean component boundaries
- **Type Safety**: All interactions are type-safe with runtime validation
- **Implementation Guidance**: Every stub contains detailed implementation hints
- **Progress Tracking**: NotImplementedError patterns enable development tracking
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and health checking
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns across seams

### Technical Debt Resolved

- Eliminated "70% wall" problem by defining contracts before implementation
- Replaced ad-hoc development with systematic SDD methodology
- Added comprehensive error handling and diagnostics framework
- Established clear testing strategy for all seam connections

## [1.0.0-alpha.1] - 2025-05-26

### Added - Initial Foundation

- **Project Structure**

  - TypeScript MCP server foundation
  - Basic package.json and tsconfig.json
  - Documentation directory structure

- **Core Implementation** (`src/index.ts` - 700+ lines)

  - 4 primary SDD functions implemented
  - MCP server with tool discovery and execution
  - Seam analysis logic with pattern recognition
  - Contract generation with SDD patterns
  - Stub generation with blueprint comments
  - Full workflow orchestration

- **Documentation**

  - Comprehensive development roadmap (`docs/sdd-mcp-roadmap.md`)
  - Implementation checklist with MVP definition
  - Extensibility framework for future enhancements

- **Dependencies**
  - @modelcontextprotocol/sdk for MCP compliance
  - Zod for runtime type validation
  - TypeScript for type safety

### Features Implemented

- Requirements analysis with seam identification
- Contract generation using proven SDD patterns
- Implementation stub creation with NotImplementedError patterns
- Integration test template generation
- Project health monitoring and readiness scoring

### Development Tools

- Build system with TypeScript compilation
- Development scripts for testing and iteration
- MCP configuration for Claude Desktop integration

## [0.1.0] - 2025-05-26 (Conceptual)

### Added - Vision and Planning

- Initial SDD MCP Server concept
- Problem identification: "70% wall" in AI-assisted development
- Solution approach: Automate proven SDD workflow
- Target: Help non-coders develop software with AI assistance

## Development Methodology Notes

### SDD Application Journey

1. **Traditional Start**: Began with direct implementation approach
2. **SDD Realization**: Recognized we should use SDD to build SDD tools
3. **Proper Analysis**: Created PRD and identified seams
4. **Contract Generation**: Built type-safe interfaces for all interactions
5. **Stub Creation**: Generated implementation-ready foundations
6. **Current State**: Ready for systematic implementation

### Key SDD Patterns Demonstrated

- **ContractResult<T>**: Consistent success/error handling
- **AgentId Tracking**: Clear component identification
- **Blueprint Comments**: Implementation guidance in contracts
- **NotImplementedError**: Progress tracking in stubs
- **Integration-First Testing**: Verify seams before details
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time and runtime validation

### Next Milestone Targets

- **Foundation Implementation**: ConfigManager + ErrorHandler
- **Template Integration**: User's existing SDD templates
- **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Full Claude Desktop integration
- **Production Deployment**: AI assistant accessibility
