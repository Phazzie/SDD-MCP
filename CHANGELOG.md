### üéØ WHAT'S NEXT
This is just the beginning! The real value comes from using these tools to build actual projects:
- Enterprise applications with complex requirements
- Multi-team development projects
- Integration-heavy systems
- Any project where clear communication between components matters

**The SDD methodology is now proven and ready for adoption. Let's build amazing things!**

## [1.0.0-alpha.2] - 2025-05-26

### üéØ MAJOR PIVOT: Adopted SDD for SDD Server Development

This release represents a fundamental shift from traditional development to using **SDD methodology to build the SDD MCP Server itself** - a perfect demonstration of "eating our own dog food"!

### Added - SDD Methodology Application

- **Requirements Document** (`docs/mcp-server-prd.md`)

  - Clear project vision and functional requirements
  - Technical and quality requirements definition
  - Success criteria and scope boundaries

- **Seam Analysis** (`docs/mcp-server-seam-analysis.md`)

  - Identified 6 critical seams in MCP server architecture
  - Defined seam dependencies and integration points
  - MCP Protocol, SDD Function, Template Processing, Validation, Error Handling, and Configuration seams

- **Contract Generation** (`src/contracts.ts`)

  - Type-safe interfaces for all 6 seams
  - ContractResult<T> pattern for consistent error handling
  - Zod schemas for runtime validation
  - Blueprint comments for implementation guidance
  - AgentId tracking for debugging and diagnostics

- **Implementation Stubs** (`src/stubs.ts`)

  - Ready-for-implementation skeletons for all agents
  - NotImplementedError patterns for progress tracking
  - Integration test templates for each seam
  - Comprehensive TODO comments with implementation hints
  - Health check framework

- **Implementation Strategy** (`docs/sdd-implementation-strategy.md`)
  - Phase-by-phase implementation plan
  - Priority order for agent development
  - Testing strategy using SDD principles
  - Benefits analysis of using SDD for SDD

### Changed - Architecture Improvements

- **Package Configuration**
