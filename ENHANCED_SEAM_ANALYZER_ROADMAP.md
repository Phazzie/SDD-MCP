Okay, this is a great way to proceed. We'll focus on systematically completing all unfinished business.

First, here's the roadmap and checklist for finishing all incomplete items, designed to be used as our guiding document.

CODE BLOCK 1: ROADMAP & CHECKLIST FOR COMPLETING INCOMPLETE TASKS

# SDD MCP Server - Roadmap for Completing Incomplete Tasks

**Overall Goal:** To bring all partially completed initiatives to a finished state, ensuring SDD compliance, clean TypeScript compilation for modified files, and passing tests for implemented features.

---

## ✅ **PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED & STABLE FOUNDATIONS**

_(This section is for reference and should not be modified unless explicitly revisiting)_

- **Phase 1-5: Core Infrastructure & SDD Compliance:**
  - `contracts.ts`: Core types (`ContractResult`, `SDDError`), Enhanced Seam Analyzer types, etc. (Largely stable, minor additions/tweaks possible).
  - `error-handler.ts`, `config-manager.ts`: Refactored for SDD error patterns.
  - `DevUtilities` & `PerformanceTracker`: Core classes defined and methods added.
- **Enhanced Seam Analyzer (in `stubs.ts` - `EnhancedSeamAnalyzerStub`):**
  - **Phase 6.1: `analyzeRequirementsEnhanced()`:** Fully Implemented & QA'd (Rule-Based).
  - **Phase 6.2: `generateInteractionMatrix()`:** Fully Implemented & QA'd (Rule-Based).
- **AI Provider Flexibility Strategy:** `AI_PROVIDER_FLEXIBILITY_GUIDE.md` created.
- **`enhanced-seam-analyzer.ts` SDD Rewrite:** Phase 1 Stub created (implementation pending).

---

## 🚧 **CURRENT PHASE: COMPLETING `analyzeDataFlows()` (Phase 6.3)**

_(This is the immediate focus. Once all items here are checked, move this entire section to "COMPLETED PHASES" below and promote the next phase from "UPCOMING PHASES" to "CURRENT PHASE".)_

**Goal:** Fully implement and test the `analyzeDataFlows()` method in `EnhancedSeamAnalyzerStub` (within `src/stubs.ts`).

**Checklist for Phase 6.3:**

- **[ ] 1. Stabilize Test Execution & Output for `tests/test-analyzeDataFlows.js`:**

  - [ ] Ensure the script runs without runtime errors (e.g., `TypeError` related to `devUtilities`).
  - [ ] Ensure all `process.stdout.write` and `process.stderr.write` calls correctly output test status and results.
  - [ ] Confirm that initial `console.log` messages added to `DevUtilities` methods (e.g., `[DevUtilities] logMessage called`) and the start of `analyzeDataFlows` are visible when tests run.
  - _(Copilot Action: Confirm or implement fixes to achieve this. Then, run tests and provide full output.)_

- **[ ] 2. Implement `mapDataFlows` Helper (Rule-Based Logic - Roadmap Step 6.3.4):**

  - [ ] In `EnhancedSeamAnalyzerStub.analyzeDataFlows`, call the private `mapDataFlows` helper.
  - [ ] Within `mapDataFlows` (in `src/stubs.ts`):
    - [ ] Implement logic to parse `input.requirements` (string).
    - [ ] Use keywords (e.g., "sends to", "receives from", "passes to", "updates in", "retrieves from") and component names from `input.components` to identify potential data flows.
    - [ ] For each flow, determine `source` (component name), `target` (component name), `dataType` (match against `identifiedDataTypes` from `identifyDataEntities` helper), and `direction` ("IN" | "OUT" | "BOTH").
    - [ ] Heuristically determine `volume` (e.g., "medium" as default).
    - [ ] Populate and return an array of `DataFlow` objects.
    - [ ] Add `this.devUtilities.logAIDiagnostic` calls for identified flows.
  - _(Copilot Action: Implement. Compile. Run `test-analyzeDataFlows.js` (focus on Test Cases 1 & 2). Debug until these tests pass or show meaningful flow identification.)_

- **[ ] 3. Implement `identifyDataTransformations` Helper (Rule-Based Logic - Roadmap Step 6.3.5):**

  - [ ] In `EnhancedSeamAnalyzerStub.analyzeDataFlows`, call the private `identifyDataTransformations` helper.
  - [ ] Within `identifyDataTransformations` (in `src/stubs.ts`):
    - [ ] Implement logic to parse `input.requirements`.
    - [ ] Use keywords (e.g., "transforms", "converts", "validates", "formats", "enriches", "aggregates") to identify potential data transformations.
    - [ ] For each transformation, determine `name`, `input` (dataType name), `output` (dataType name), and `logic` (description from requirements).
    - [ ] Heuristically determine `complexity` (e.g., "moderate" as default).
    - [ ] Populate and return an array of `DataTransformation` objects.
    - [ ] Add `this.devUtilities.logAIDiagnostic` calls for identified transformations.
  - _(Copilot Action: Implement. Compile. Run `test-analyzeDataFlows.js` (focus on Test Case 3). Debug until this test passes or shows meaningful transformation identification.)_

- **[ ] 4. Implement `detectPotentialBottlenecks` & `assessDataConsistency` Helpers (Initial Pass - Roadmap Step 6.3.6):**

  - [ ] In `EnhancedSeamAnalyzerStub.analyzeDataFlows`, call these private helpers.
  - [ ] Within `detectPotentialBottlenecks` (in `src/stubs.ts`):
    - [ ] Implement simple rule-based logic using keywords (e.g., "slow", "awaits", "external call", "large volume") from `input.requirements` to populate an array of bottleneck description strings.
  - [ ] Within `assessDataConsistency` (in `src/stubs.ts`):
    - [ ] Implement simple rule-based logic using keywords (e.g., "must match", "consistent", "synchronized") from `input.requirements` to return a heuristic `dataConsistencyScore` (number between 0 and 1).
  - [ ] Add `this.devUtilities.logAIDiagnostic` calls for findings.
  - _(Copilot Action: Implement. Compile. Run `test-analyzeDataFlows.js` (focus on Test Case 4). Debug until this test passes or shows meaningful insights.)_

- **[ ] 5. Finalize `analyzeDataFlows` Result Object & Metadata (Roadmap Step 6.3.7):**

  - [ ] Ensure `analyzeDataFlows` correctly populates the `DataFlowAnalysis` object with results from all helpers (`identifiedDataEntities`, `mapDataFlows`, `identifyDataTransformations`, `detectPotentialBottlenecks`).
  - [ ] Ensure `metadata.flowComplexity` and `metadata.dataConsistencyScore` are calculated and populated.
  - _(Copilot Action: Implement. Compile. Run all test cases in `test-analyzeDataFlows.js`. Debug until all pass.)_

- **[ ] 6. Review & Refine `analyzeDataFlows` Implementation:**
  - [ ] Review all new code in `analyzeDataFlows` and its helpers for clarity, SDD compliance, error handling, and logging.
  - [ ] Remove any temporary `console.log` statements used for debugging.
  - _(Copilot Action: Self-review and apply refinements.)_

---

## ⏳ **UPCOMING PHASES (To be moved to "CURRENT PHASE" one by one)**

### **Phase 6.4: `validateSeamReadiness()` (💰 HIGH_ROI)**

_Goal: Implement the `validateSeamReadiness()` method in `EnhancedSeamAnalyzerStub`._

- **[ ] 1. Understand Contract:** Review `SeamValidationInput` and `SeamValidationResult` in `contracts.ts`.
- **[ ] 2. Implement Input Validation:** Validate `input.seams` and `input.requirements`.
- **[ ] 3. Implement Core Validation Logic (Rule-Based):**
  - [ ] Completeness Check: Ensure `SeamDefinition` objects have `name`, `participants` (>=2), `dataFlow`, `purpose`, `contractInterface`.
  - [ ] Consistency Check: Check for duplicate seam names, valid `dataFlow` values.
  - [ ] Basic Implementability Heuristics: (e.g., is `purpose` too vague? Are there too many participants?).
  - [ ] SDD Compliance Heuristics: (e.g., does `contractInterface` follow naming conventions like `I[Name]Contract`?).
- **[ ] 4. Generate Recommendations:** Based on validation checks, create an array of string recommendations.
- **[ ] 5. Calculate Compliance Score:** Develop a heuristic to calculate a score (0-1).
- **[ ] 6. Construct `SeamValidationResult` Object:** Populate `validSeams`, `invalidSeams` (as `SeamValidationError[]`), `recommendations`, `complianceScore`.
- **[ ] 7. Error Handling & `ContractResult`:** Implement standard error handling.
- **[ ] 8. DevUtilities Logging:** Integrate logging.
- **[ ] 9. Create Test Script `test-validateSeamReadiness.js`:** Include various valid and invalid `SeamDefinition` inputs.
- **[ ] 10. Test, Debug, Refine.**

### **Decision Point: `EnhancedSeamAnalyzerStub` vs. `enhanced-seam-analyzer.ts` Rewrite**

_Goal: Decide the path forward for the primary Enhanced Seam Analyzer implementation._

- **[ ] 1. Evaluate Current `EnhancedSeamAnalyzerStub`:** After Phases 6.1-6.4 are complete, assess its complexity and maintainability.
- **[ ] 2. Review `enhanced-seam-analyzer.ts` (Phase 1 SDD Stub):** Recall its clean structure.
- **[ ] 3. Make a Decision (Phazzie with Copilot's input):**
  - **Option A:** Continue building on `EnhancedSeamAnalyzerStub` in `stubs.ts`. Rename the class and file if it becomes the primary implementation.
  - **Option B:** Port/Re-implement the logic from `EnhancedSeamAnalyzerStub` (Phases 6.1-6.4) into the cleaner SDD structure of `src/agents/enhanced-seam-analyzer.ts`. This would be a focused refactoring effort.
- _(Copilot Action: Discuss pros and cons with Phazzie. Implement the chosen option.)_

### **Phase 6.5 & 6.6: AI-Enhanced Seam Validation & Refinement (🧠 AI_ENHANCEMENT)**

_Goal: Integrate Gemini (or other AI) for advanced seam analysis capabilities._

- **[ ] 1. Implement `AIProviderContract` and `AIProviderManager`:** (Refer to `AI_PROVIDER_FLEXIBILITY_GUIDE.md`).
- **[ ] 2. Implement Gemini Provider:** Create a class that calls the Gemini API.
- **[ ] 3. Integrate into `analyzeRequirementsEnhanced` (or chosen primary analyzer):**
  - After rule-based analysis, send requirements and identified seams to AI for validation/enhancement.
  - Prompt AI: "Did the rule-based system miss any seams? Can existing seams be refined?"
  - Merge AI suggestions (with confidence scores) into the final `EnhancedSeamAnalysis`.
- **[ ] 4. Implement Graceful Degradation:** If AI call fails or times out, return rule-based results.
- **[ ] 5. Configuration:** Add options to enable/disable AI enhancement, set API keys, model preferences.
- **[ ] 6. Test AI Integration.**

### **Phase 7: Integration with Utilities & MCP Tools (🔌 INTEGRATION)**

_Goal: Ensure Enhanced Seam Analyzer works seamlessly within the broader MCP ecosystem._

- **[ ] 1. Full `EnhancedSeamAnalyzerWithUtilities` Integration:** Verify all methods correctly use `DevUtilities` and `PerformanceTracker`.
- **[ ] 2. MCP Tool Updates:**
  - Update `enhanced-seam-analysis-tool.ts`, `generate-interaction-matrix-tool.ts`, etc., in `src/tools/` to correctly call the now-implemented Enhanced Seam Analyzer methods.
  - Ensure they handle `ContractResult<T>` and `SDDError` properly.
- **[ ] 3. Test End-to-End MCP Tool Flows.**

### **Phase 8: Broader TypeScript Error Resolution & System Stability (🛡️ DEFENSIVE)**

_Goal: Eliminate remaining TypeScript errors across the project for a fully stable build._

- **[ ] 1. Systematic Error Fixing:**
  - Use `tsc_errors.txt` (Phazzie to provide latest if necessary).
  - Address errors file by file (e.g., `sdd-analyzer.ts`, `mcp-tool-registry.ts`, `index.ts`, `seams.ts`, remaining test files).
  - Apply established patterns for `ContractResult`, `SDDError`, and metadata.
- **[ ] 2. Achieve Clean Project-Wide `npx tsc` build.**

Now, for the helper prompt and the first prompt for Copilot in the new chat:

CODE BLOCK 2: HELPER PROMPT (FOR YOU, PHAZZIE, TO PASTE FIRST) & FIRST TASKING PROMPT

**(PHAZZIE: This is the HELPER PROMPT. Paste this ENTIRE markdown block as your _first_ message to the new GitHub Copilot chat session.)**

---

**PROMPT FOR GITHUB COPILOT: SDD MCP Server - Project Continuity & Tasking Brief (Session #X)**

**SECTION 1: YOUR ROLE & CORE METHODOLOGY (`🎯 COPILOT_ACTION: UNDERSTAND & INTERNALIZE`)**

Hello, Copilot. We are working on a project called the "SDD MCP Server." Your primary role is to act as an AI Programming Assistant to help me develop this server. We are strictly following a methodology called **Seam-Driven Development (SDD)**.

**What is Seam-Driven Development (SDD)?**
SDD is a software design and implementation methodology where we prioritize defining and stabilizing the **communication pathways (seams)** between different software components _before_ we write the detailed logic inside those components. Think of seams as the contracts that dictate how components will talk to each other.

**Our Strict SDD Workflow (You MUST follow this):**

1.  **Identify Seams:** What are the logical points of interaction or communication?
2.  **Define Contracts:** For each seam, what is the precise TypeScript `interface` or `type` defining the methods, inputs, and outputs?
    - All contract methods MUST be `async` and return a `Promise<ContractResult<T>>`.
3.  **Create Stubs:** Implement skeleton versions of the components/methods. These stubs initially just "fail fast" by throwing a `NotImplementedError` or returning a structured error, but they MUST conform to the defined contract.
4.  **Test Connections (Conceptual for now):** Ensure the stubs and contracts align perfectly.
5.  **Implement:** Only after the above steps are solid, we fill in the actual working logic.

**Key Slogan:** **"Seams First, Implementation Second."**

**Essential Code Patterns You MUST Use:**

- **`ContractResult<T>` Pattern:** (Defined in `c:\Users\thump\SkepticalWombat\src\contracts.ts`)
  ```typescript
  export type ContractResult<T> = {
    success: boolean;
    data?: T;
    error?: SDDError; // This is an OBJECT, not a string.
    metadata?: {
      agentId: string; // Mandatory in metadata
      timestamp: string; // Mandatory in metadata
      [key: string]: any; // Allows for other custom metadata
    };
  };
  ```
- **`SDDError` Object Pattern:** (Defined in `c:\Users\thump\SkepticalWombat\src\contracts.ts`)
  ```typescript
  export interface SDDError {
    /* ... as defined in contracts.ts ... */
  }
  // Use helper functions like createSDDError(), createDetailedError() from contracts.ts.
  ```
- **File Imports:** Use `.js` extensions for relative imports (e.g., `import { TypeX } from '../contracts.js';`).

**Your Primary Goal for This Session:** Help me systematically complete partially finished tasks for the "Enhanced Seam Analyzer" and resolve TypeScript errors, strictly following SDD.

---

**SECTION 2: PROJECT OVERVIEW & CURRENT FOCUS (`📚 COPILOT_ACTION: UNDERSTAND PROJECT CONTEXT`)**

We are building the Enhanced Seam Analyzer agent within the SDD MCP Server. This agent analyzes software requirements to identify components, seams, data flows, etc.

- **`EnhancedSeamAnalyzerStub` (in `src/stubs.ts`):** This class is where we've been implementing the core rule-based logic.
  - `analyzeRequirementsEnhanced()` (Phase 6.1): **COMPLETED & QA'd.**
  - `generateInteractionMatrix()` (Phase 6.2): **COMPLETED & QA'd.**
  - `analyzeDataFlows()` (Phase 6.3): **CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS.**
- **`tests/test-analyzeDataFlows.js`:** Test script for `analyzeDataFlows`.
- **`ENHANCED_SEAM_ANALYZER_ROADMAP.md`:** Contains the detailed checklist of tasks for each phase. I (Phazzie) will provide its content if you need to reference specific checklist items.

---

**SECTION 3: SUMMARY OF WHERE WE LEFT OFF (`⏪ COPILOT_ACTION: UNDERSTAND RECENT HISTORY`)**

1.  We were actively working on **Phase 6.3: `analyzeDataFlows()`** within `EnhancedSeamAnalyzerStub` in `src/stubs.ts`.
2.  The `test-analyzeDataFlows.js` script was created. Initial issues with ES Module imports and paths to compiled `dist` files were resolved.
3.  The last major problem encountered was a `TypeError: this.devUtilities.logError is not a function`. This was fixed by adding `logMessage`, `logError`, and `logAIDiagnostic` methods to the `DevUtilities` class in `src/agents/dev-utilities.ts`.
4.  After fixing that, the test script ran without throwing an immediate `TypeError`, but the actual test cases (1-4, for Simple Flow, Multiple Flows, etc.) were still failing their assertions. This indicates that the core rule-based logic within `analyzeDataFlows` and its helper methods (`mapDataFlows`, `identifyDataTransformations`, etc.) is incomplete or incorrect.
5.  The immediate next step identified was to get `test-analyzeDataFlows.js` to produce clear output for each test case, and then to systematically implement/debug the helper methods for `analyzeDataFlows`.

**SECTION 5: MY EXPECTATIONS FOR YOUR BEHAVIOR (`🤖 COPILOT_ACTION: NOTE DIRECTIVES`)**

1.  **SDD First:** Always prioritize SDD principles.
2.  **Incremental Chunks:** Break down your work into logical sub-steps. After each significant sub-step, confirm success or describe issues.
3.  **Compilation Checks:** After applying code changes to `.ts` files, state that you will (or I should) run `npx tsc`. Report the outcome.
4.  **Clarity on File Changes:** Clearly state which file you intend to modify.
5.  **Context Awareness & Ripple Effect:** If my instructions seem to conflict with established patterns or might have wide-ranging impacts, flag this. Consider the "Impact Radius" of changes.

**(PHAZZIE: This is the FIRST TASKING PROMPT. After Copilot acknowledges the Helper Prompt above, give it this prompt.)**

Okay, Copilot, thank you for processing the project briefing.

Our immediate focus is **Task 1 from the "CURRENT PHASE: COMPLETING `analyzeDataFlows()` (Phase 6.3)"** section of our roadmap (which is item #1 on the checklist in `ENHANCED_SEAM_ANALYZER_ROADMAP.md`).

**Your first actions:**

1.  **Stabilize Test Execution & Output for `tests/test-analyzeDataFlows.js`:**
    _ **Read `tests/test-analyzeDataFlows.js`**.
    _ Ensure the script will run without runtime errors (we last fixed a `TypeError` related to `devUtilities`).
    _ Ensure all `process.stdout.write` and `process.stderr.write` calls correctly output test status and results for each of the 5 main test cases. The goal is to see clear "Test Case X PASSED" or "Test Case X FAILED: [Reason]" messages.
    _ Confirm that the initial diagnostic `console.log` messages we previously added to `DevUtilities` methods (e.g., `[DevUtilities] logMessage called`) and to the beginning of `analyzeDataFlows` in `stubs.ts` are indeed visible when the tests are run. If not, investigate why.
    _ Apply any necessary changes to `tests/test-analyzeDataFlows.js` or `src/stubs.ts` (for initial logging) to achieve this.
    _ After changes, state that the next step is to compile (`npx tsc`) and then run the test script (`node tests/test-analyzeDataFlows.js`). \* Once you are ready for me to run these commands, let me know, and I will provide you with the full console output.

Explanation and Instructions for Phazzie:

Roadmap File (Code Block 1):

What to do with it: Save this content as ENHANCED_SEAM_ANALYZER_ROADMAP.md in your c:\Users\thump\SkepticalWombat\ directory. This will be your living document to track progress.

How to use it:

The "CURRENT PHASE" section contains a detailed checklist for the task at hand (analyzeDataFlows).

As Copilot completes items, you (or Copilot, with your confirmation) will mark them with [X].

Once all items in the "CURRENT PHASE" checklist are done, you will manually copy that entire phase's content (including its title and goal) into the "PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED & STABLE FOUNDATIONS" section of the roadmap file.

Then, you will manually copy the next phase from "UPCOMING PHASES" (e.g., Phase 6.4) into the "CURRENT PHASE" section, making its checklist active.

Repeat this process until all phases are complete.

Helper Prompt & First Tasking Prompt (Code Block 2):

What to do with it:

The first part, labeled **(PHAZZIE: This is the HELPER PROMPT...)**, is what you will paste as the very first message into your new GitHub Copilot chat session. This gives Copilot all the necessary background.

The second part, labeled **(PHAZZIE: This is the FIRST TASKING PROMPT...)**, is what you will send as your second message to Copilot, right after it has acknowledged and processed the helper prompt. This tells Copilot exactly what to do first.

Why this structure: The helper prompt is a one-time setup for the new chat session. The tasking prompt then kicks off the actual work. This separation keeps the initial context dump clean and then provides a clear starting instruction.

This approach ensures the new Copilot instance has a thorough understanding of SDD, our project's history, current state, resources, and your expectations, and then gives it a very specific, actionable first step that aligns with our roadmap.
