# üöÄ **SDD MCP Server Tool Registry Integration Project**

## üìã **Project Overview**

**Objective**: Integrate the existing Tool Registry system with the main MCP server to enable all 6 core SDD tools and establish foundation for dynamic tool discovery.

**Current State**: Server has dual architecture - 2 tools work via individual imports, 4 tools exist in Tool Registry but aren't accessible.

**Target State**: Unified architecture where Tool Registry manages all tools, enabling dynamic discovery and Version 2.0 features.

## üéØ **Claude Desktop Integration Prompt**

```
You are taking over an SDD MCP Server project that needs Tool Registry integration. Here's the complete context:

CURRENT SITUATION:
- MCP server runs successfully but only 2/6 core tools are accessible
- 4 tools exist in a Tool Registry system but aren't connected to the main server
- Dual architecture needs to be unified for long-term scalability

PROJECT GOAL:
Integrate the Tool Registry with the main MCP server to enable all 6 core SDD tools and establish foundation for dynamic tool discovery.

WORKING DIRECTORY: C:\Users\thump\SkepticalWombat

KEY FILES TO UNDERSTAND:
- src/index.ts (main server - currently only imports 2 tools)
- src/tool-registry.ts (sophisticated modular system - has 5 tools registered)
- src/tool-registry-setup.ts (registers enhanced tools to registry)
- ai-collaboration/AI_COLLABORATION_LOG.md (document decisions here)

CURRENT TOOL STATUS:
‚úÖ Working: sdd_validate_compliance, sdd_introduction_tutorial
‚ùå Missing: sdd_analyze_requirements, sdd_generate_contract, sdd_create_stub, sdd_orchestrate_full_workflow, sdd_visualize_architecture

ARCHITECTURE ISSUE:
The main server (src/index.ts) has a tool switch statement that only handles 2 tools, but there's a complete Tool Registry system with 5 tools that isn't connected.

INTEGRATION PLAN:
1. Connect Tool Registry to main server switch statement
2. Add missing 4 legacy tools to Tool Registry
3. Test integrated system
4. Update Claude Desktop config with all 6 tools
5. Document work in AI_COLLABORATION_LOG.md

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All 6 core SDD tools accessible in Claude Desktop
- Unified architecture (no dual system)
- Foundation for dynamic tool discovery established
- Server compiles and runs without errors

IMPORTANT: Follow SDD principles - identify seams, create contracts, implement incrementally. Document major decisions in the collaboration log.

The server currently runs successfully. Your job is architectural integration, not debugging. Work systematically and test each integration step.

## üìä **Project Information**

**Project Name**: SDD MCP Server Tool Registry Integration  
**Duration**: 2-4 hours  
**Complexity**: Medium (architectural integration)  
**Risk Level**: Low (server currently stable)  

**Prerequisites**:
- TypeScript/Node.js familiarity
- Understanding of MCP (Model Context Protocol) architecture
- SDD (Seam-Driven Development) methodology awareness

**Dependencies**:
- Server currently running and stable
- Tool Registry system already implemented
- All individual tools exist (just need integration)

**Success Metrics**:
- 6/6 tools accessible in Claude Desktop tool menu
- Single unified architecture (eliminate dual system)
- Clean compilation with no errors
- Documentation updated in collaboration log

**Rollback Plan**:
- Current server state is stable
- All changes are additive (low risk)
- Can revert to current 2-tool system if needed

## üîó **Quick Start Commands**

Once Claude starts working:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd C:\Users\thump\SkepticalWombat

# Check current compilation
npx tsc

# Run server (currently works with 2 tools)
npm start

# Check tool files
ls src/tools/legacy/

# Review registry setup
cat src/tool-registry-setup.ts
```

**First Task**: Review the architecture and document the integration approach in `ai-collaboration/AI_COLLABORATION_LOG.md`

This project will transform your SDD MCP server from a basic 2-tool system to a sophisticated 6-tool platform ready for dynamic expansion! üéâ
