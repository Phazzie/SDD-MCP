# SDD MCP Server - Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Vision

Build an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides AI assistants with Seam-Driven Development tools to help non-coders develop software by automating the proven SDD workflow.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **MCP Protocol Compliance**: Server must implement MCP specification for tool discovery and execution
2. **SDD Workflow Automation**: Provide tools that mirror the proven SDD process:
   - PRD/Requirements analysis → Seam identification
   - Seam analysis → Contract generation
   - Contract generation → Stub creation
   - Stub creation → Integration testing setup
   - Full workflow orchestration
3. **Template Integration**: Support user's existing contract templates and seam patterns
4. **Validation Framework**: Verify contract compliance and project health
5. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with diagnostic information

### Technical Requirements

1. **TypeScript Implementation**: Type-safe development with proper interfaces
2. **Zod Validation**: Runtime type validation for all inputs/outputs
3. **ES Module Support**: Modern JavaScript module system
4. **Claude Desktop Integration**: Seamless connection via MCP configuration
5. **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for future SDD discoveries

### Quality Requirements

1. **Reliability**: Handle malformed inputs gracefully
2. **Performance**: Fast response times for AI assistant integration
3. **Maintainability**: Clean, documented code following SDD principles
4. **Testability**: Comprehensive test coverage for all seams

## Success Criteria

- AI assistants can successfully use all 4 core SDD functions
- Generated contracts follow proven SDD patterns
- Created stubs are ready for implementation
- Full workflow produces deployable project structure
- Integration with Claude Desktop works seamlessly

## Out of Scope (for MVP)

- Visual UI components
- Database persistence
- User authentication
- Advanced analytics
