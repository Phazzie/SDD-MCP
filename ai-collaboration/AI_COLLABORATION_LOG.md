# ü§ù AI Collaboration Log

## Purpose

This log tracks major decisions, handoffs, and architectural choices made during multi-AI SDD development.

## üìã Session: MCP Tool Architecture Refactor

### Entry 1: Project Initiation

**Date**: June 3, 2025 - 14:00  
**Participants**: User, Copilot  
**Decision**: Reject hybrid approach in favor of proper architectural refactor  
**Reasoning**: Avoid technical debt, implement scalable solution, follow SDD principles  
**Impact**: Higher upfront effort but cleaner long-term architecture

### Entry 2: AI Collaboration Framework Setup

**Date**: June 3, 2025 - 14:30  
**Participants**: User, Copilot  
**Decision**: Implement multi-AI collaboration with file-based communication  
**Reasoning**: Leverage both AI strengths, create reusable collaboration patterns  
**Impact**: Sets precedent for future multi-AI SDD projects

### Entry 3: Task Assignment to Gemini

**Date**: June 3, 2025 - 14:45  
**Participants**: Copilot  
**Decision**: Assign tool registry architecture implementation to Gemini  
**Seam Boundaries**:

- Gemini: Tool Registry + Module Refactoring
- Copilot: Integration + Testing + Documentation  
  **Contracts**: ToolModule and ToolRegistry interfaces defined  
  **Success Criteria**: 4 enhanced tools properly registered with modular architecture

## üîó Architectural Decisions

### Decision 1: Tool Registration Architecture

**Problem**: Enhanced tools imported but not registered in MCP server  
**Options Considered**:

1. Direct registration (quick fix)
2. Modular registry system (architectural)
3. Hybrid approach (compromise)

**Decision**: Modular registry system  
**Rationale**: Follows SDD principles, scales for future tools, avoids technical debt  
**Seam Definition**: Clear separation between tool definitions and MCP server orchestration

### Decision 2: Multi-AI Work Distribution

**Problem**: Complex refactor requires significant implementation work  
**Decision**: Leverage Gemini for implementation, Copilot for integration/testing  
**Rationale**: Plays to each AI's strengths, creates reproducible collaboration pattern  
**Risk Mitigation**: Clear contracts and handoff procedures defined

## üö® Critical Notes

### Note 1: SDD Compliance

All code must follow SDD patterns:

- ContractResult<T> for all async operations
- Blueprint comments for future implementation
- Clear seam boundaries and communication pathways
- Fail-fast error handling

### Note 2: Backward Compatibility

During transition, existing 9 tools must remain functional. Registry system should integrate seamlessly without breaking changes.

## üîÑ Pending Decisions

1. **Template Integration Strategy**: How to connect enhanced analyzer to template system
2. **Error Handling Standardization**: Which SDDError patterns to implement
3. **End-to-End Testing Approach**: Manual vs automated testing strategy
