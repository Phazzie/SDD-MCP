# ðŸ“¦ GEMINI LEGACY TOOL OUTPUTS - Expected Deliverables

## ðŸ“‹ Expected Output Summary

Gemini should deliver two complete working tool implementations with a brief comparison analysis. **IMPORTANT: Actually write all the code - do not use placeholders, comments, or "TODO" items. Provide complete, functional implementations that can be immediately tested and used.**

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Deliverables:

â€¢ **Two complete tool files** (~200-300 lines total):
  - `src/tools/legacy/sdd-analyze-requirements-tool.ts` (complete rewrite approach)
  - `src/tools/legacy/sdd-generate-contract-tool.ts` (modification approach)

â€¢ **Updated registry setup** - Add both tools to `src/tool-registry-setup.ts`

â€¢ **Brief comparison** (1-2 paragraphs):
  - Which approach was faster/easier to implement
  - Recommendation for the remaining 4 legacy tools
  - Estimated effort for full migration

â€¢ **Test confirmation** - Verify both tools work via ToolRegistry

**Expected Length**: 200-300 lines of actual code + 200-400 words of analysis

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Write complete, functional code - no placeholders or incomplete implementations!**
