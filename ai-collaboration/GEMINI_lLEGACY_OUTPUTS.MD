# üì¶ GEMINI LEGACY TOOL OUTPUTS - Expected Deliverables

**Delivery Date**: [To be filled by Gemini]  
**Task Reference**: Legacy Tool Modernization Experiments  
**Status**: üîÑ **PENDING DELIVERY**

---

## üìã **Expected Output Summary**

Gemini should deliver **two complete tool implementations** with detailed comparison analysis to determine the optimal migration strategy for the remaining 4 legacy SDD tools. The deliverables will provide concrete data on development effort, code quality, and maintainability differences between full rewrite vs. adaptive modification approaches, enabling informed decisions for the remaining legacy tool migrations (`sdd_create_stub`, `sdd_orchestrate_full_workflow`, `sdd_visualize_architecture`, `sdd_validate_compliance`).

## üéØ **EXPERIMENT 1: Complete Rewrite Deliverables**

### **Expected Files** (Estimated: 150-200 lines total)

- [ ] **`src/tools/legacy/sdd-analyze-requirements-tool.ts`** (120-150 lines)
  - Complete `ToolModuleContract` implementation
  - Zod input/output schemas with validation
  - Enhanced seam detection logic (rewritten from scratch)
  - `ContractResult<T>` error handling
  - Integration with `mcpIntelligenceBridge` where beneficial

### **Expected Implementation Features**

- [ ] **Input Schema**: `prdText` (required), `designNotes` (optional)
- [ ] **Output Schema**: Structured seam definitions with metadata
- [ ] **Enhanced Analysis**: Improved seam detection algorithms
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and fail-fast patterns
- [ ] **Documentation**: Blueprint comments explaining implementation strategy

---

## üéØ **EXPERIMENT 2: Adaptive Modification Deliverables**

### **Expected Files** (Estimated: 80-120 lines total)

- [ ] **`src/tools/legacy/sdd-generate-contract-tool.ts`** (80-100 lines)
  - `ToolModuleContract` wrapper around existing logic
  - Minimal Zod schema (based on current SeamDefinition)
  - Preserved `templateProcessor.generateFromSeam()` functionality
  - `ContractResult<T>` response wrapping
  - Maintained compatibility with existing output format

### **Expected Implementation Features**

- [ ] **Input Schema**: SeamDefinition object validation
- [ ] **Logic Preservation**: Existing contract generation maintained
- [ ] **Response Adaptation**: MCP format wrapped in `ContractResult<T>`
- [ ] **Minimal Changes**: Focus on architectural compliance over enhancement

## üìä **COMPARISON ANALYSIS DELIVERABLES**

### **Development Metrics** (Expected: 1-2 pages)

- [ ] **Time Investment**:
  - Experiment 1 (Rewrite): [X hours] with breakdown
  - Experiment 2 (Modify): [X hours] with breakdown
- [ ] **Code Quality Metrics**:
  - Lines of code comparison
  - Complexity assessment (cognitive load, maintainability)
  - Type safety improvements
  - Error handling robustness

### **Performance & Functionality Assessment**

- [ ] **Functional Compatibility**: Both tools produce equivalent outputs
- [ ] **Performance Impact**: Any speed/memory differences observed
- [ ] **Integration Quality**: Registry integration success rate
- [ ] **Testing Results**: All tests pass, compilation successful
