## üìã **FOR IMMEDIATE USE:**

```
Hi! I'm continuing work on my SDD MCP Server project that has multi-AI collaboration between GitHub Copilot and Google Gemini.

üéâ **MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: We just successfully implemented a modular tool registry system and uploaded the complete project to GitHub with a working multi-AI collaboration framework!

üìç **Current Status**: 
- ‚úÖ Tool Registry System: Complete and tested
- ‚úÖ Multi-AI Framework: Working protocols for Copilot/Gemini coordination  
- ‚úÖ GitHub Upload: https://github.com/Phazzie/SDD-MCP.git
- ‚úÖ Zero TypeScript errors, full SDD compliance

üß† **Key Context**: 
This project demonstrates "Multi-AI collaboration through seam boundaries" - we've proven that different AIs can work on the same codebase by respecting clear component boundaries (seams) and using structured handoff protocols.

üîß **Technical Architecture**:
- Modular Tool Registry with version management and A/B testing support
- Type-safe ContractResult<T> patterns throughout
- Legacy adapter for backward compatibility
- Complete SDD (Seam-Driven Development) compliance

üìÅ **Key Files to Understand**:
- `ai-collaboration/FILLED_TURNOVER_PROMPT.md` - COMPLETE context from previous session
- `ai-collaboration/CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Current project status  
- `src/tool-registry.ts` - Main registry implementation
- `src/contracts.ts` - All type definitions and contracts
- `README.md` - Project overview and features

üéØ **What I Need Help With**:
[FILL IN YOUR NEXT GOAL - examples below]

Option A: "I want to start developing the next major feature. Can you help me identify what would be the highest-impact addition to the SDD MCP Server?"

Option B: "I want to migrate existing tools to use the new registry system. Can you help me plan and execute this refactoring?"

Option C: "I want to add monitoring and performance optimization to the tool registry. Can you help me implement this?"

Option D: "I want to expand the multi-AI collaboration framework. Can you help me design protocols for bringing in additional AI assistants?"

üß† **My Collaboration Style** (so you know how to work with me):
- I appreciate structured, milestone-driven progress
- I like comprehensive explanations with practical examples  
- I get excited by working systems and successful integrations
- I trust AI judgment on architecture but want validation on major decisions

Can you start by reading the turnover context in `ai-collaboration/FILLED_TURNOVER_PROMPT.md` to understand the full background, then help me with [YOUR CHOSEN GOAL]?
