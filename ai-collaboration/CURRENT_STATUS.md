a# 🎯 SDD MCP Server - Current Status

**Last Updated**: June 9, 2025  
**Active Phase**: **Phase D - Final Integration, Testing & Documentation**  
**Previous Phase**: ✅ **Phase C - Legacy Tool Modernization** (Stubs Completed, Core Logic Implementation Underway)

---

## 📊 **Phase Status Overview**

### ✅ **COMPLETED - Phase C: Legacy Tool Modernization (Initial Stubbing & Core Implementations)**

**Objective**: Rewrite all remaining legacy SDD tools using modern ToolModuleContract architecture. Implement core logic for key tools.  
**Completion of Stubs**: June 6, 2025  
**Ongoing**: Implementation of core logic, integration of advanced features.

**Results from Stubbing & Initial Implementation**:

- ✅ All 4 core SDD tool stubs created (`sdd-create-stub-tool.ts`, `sdd-orchestrate-workflow-tool.ts`, `sdd-visualize-architecture-tool.ts`, `sdd-validate-compliance-tool.ts`) adhering to `ToolModuleContract`.
- ✅ `sdd-create-stub-tool.ts` (Stub Generator): Fully Implemented and reviewed.
- ✅ `sdd-visualize-architecture-tool.ts` (Architecture Visualizer): Fully Implemented and reviewed.
- 🔄 `sdd-validate-compliance-tool.ts` (Compliance Validator): Advanced AST-based implementation from Gemini (`docs/Geminitoolvalidate.md`) integrated; **PENDING FINAL TESTING & RULESET EXPANSION**.
- 🟡 `sdd-orchestrate-workflow-tool.ts` (Orchestrator): Foundational structure in place; **PENDING FULL CORE LOGIC IMPLEMENTATION (HIGH PRIORITY)**.

### 🚀 **CURRENT PHASE - Phase D: Final Integration, Testing & Documentation**

**Objective**: Complete all tool implementations, conduct comprehensive testing, finalize all documentation, and prepare for project handoff.  
**Start Date**: June 9, 2025

**Key Focus Areas for Phase D**:

1.  **Orchestrator Implementation**: Complete `sdd-orchestrate-workflow-tool.ts`.
2.  **Validator Finalization**: Thoroughly test `sdd-validate-compliance-tool.ts`, expand its ruleset, and ensure robust AST-level validation.
3.  **Comprehensive Testing**:
    - Unit tests for all tool modules.
    - Integration tests for tool interactions (especially via orchestrator).
    - End-to-end (E2E) tests for the full SDD workflow.
4.  **Documentation Completion**: Finalize READMEs, user guides, `PROJECT_TURNOVER_DETAILED_20250608.md`, and ensure all `ai-collaboration/` documents are current.
5.  **"Surprise & Delight" Features**: Implement planned enhancements (e.g., auto-fix suggestions).
6.  **CI/CD Preparation**: Ensure project is ready for CI/CD pipeline integration.

## 🔄 **Next Actions**

### **Immediate (Phase D Start)**

1.  **Orchestrator (`sdd-orchestrate-workflow-tool.ts`)**:
    - Define detailed step-by-step logic for PRD Analysis -> Seam ID -> Contract Gen -> Stub Creation -> Connection Testing -> Impl. Handoff.
    - Implement invocation of other SDD tools (`stubber`, `visualizer`, `validator`).
    - Manage data flow and state between workflow steps.
    - Implement robust error handling and reporting for the orchestration process.
2.  **Validator (`sdd-validate-compliance-tool.ts`)**:
    - Conduct comprehensive testing of existing AST-based validation rules.
    - Expand ruleset based on `docs/SDD_TOOL_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLISTS.md`.
    - Implement support for external configuration/plugins for custom rules.
    - Develop and test meta-validation capabilities.
    - Begin work on auto-fix suggestions.
3.  **Testing Framework**:
    - Set up or enhance unit testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
    - Develop initial unit tests for the orchestrator and validator.
4.  **Documentation**:
    - Ensure `PROJECT_TURNOVER_DETAILED_20250608.md` is fully up-to-date with these plans.
    - Update `ai-collaboration/AI_COLLABORATION_LOG.md` with the commencement of Phase D.

### **Dependencies for Phase D**

- ✅ Stable implementations of `sdd-create-stub-tool.ts` and `sdd-visualize-architecture-tool.ts`.
- ✅ Core AST-engine from Gemini for `sdd-validate-compliance-tool.ts`.
- ✅ Clear requirements from `ai-collaboration/SDD_ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` and `docs/SDD_TOOL_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLISTS.md`.

### **Risk Mitigation**

- **Orchestrator Complexity**: Break down implementation into smaller, testable modules. Implement step-by-step.
- **Validator Extensibility**: Design plugin architecture carefully for maintainability and ease of use.
- **Testing Scope**: Prioritize critical path testing first, then expand to edge cases.

**Status**: Ready to proceed with **Phase D - Final Integration, Testing & Documentation**.
