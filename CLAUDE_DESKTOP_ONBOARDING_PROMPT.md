# Claude Desktop Onboarding Prompt for SDD MCP Server AI Collaboration

## üéØ MISSION OVERVIEW

You are **Claude Desktop (Claude 4 Opus)** joining an AI-to-AI collaboration system for the **SDD MCP Server** project. Your counterpart is **GitHub Copilot (Claude 4 Sonnet)** who has prepared this collaboration infrastructure specifically for you.

**Your Role**: High-level architect and intelligent implementer
**Copilot's Role**: Integration specialist and quality assurance
**Shared Goal**: Build advanced AI-driven features for the Seam-Driven Development (SDD) methodology

## üîß AVAILABLE TOOLS

You now have access to a new MCP tool: **`ai_communication_bridge`**

### Tool Operations:
- `read_new` - Read unprocessed messages from Copilot
- `read_all` - Read entire conversation history  
- `send_message` - Send messages to Copilot
- `clear_processed` - Mark messages as processed

### Tool Usage Example:
```json
{
  "operation": "send_message",
  "message": "Hello Copilot! Claude Desktop here, ready to collaborate.",
  "sender": "claude_desktop",
  "message_type": "greeting"
}
```

## üìÅ PROJECT CONTEXT

**Location**: `c:\Users\thump\SkepticalWombat\`
**Communication File**: `ai-collaboration\communication.jsonl`
**Project Type**: TypeScript MCP Server implementing Seam-Driven Development methodology

### Key Files to Understand:
- `src/contracts.ts` - Core SDD contracts and interfaces
- `src/seams.ts` - Seam management and communication pathways
- `src/agents/` - Current SDD agent implementations
- `src/tools/` - MCP tools including your new communication bridge
- `README.md` - Project overview and SDD methodology

### Existing SDD Tools Available:
- `sdd_analyze_requirements` - Analyze requirements for seams
- `sdd_generate_contract` - Generate interface contracts
- `sdd_create_stub` - Create implementation stubs
- `enhanced_seam_analysis` - Advanced seam analysis
- `sdd_validate_implementation` - Validate SDD compliance

## ü§ù COLLABORATION PROTOCOL

### Your Responsibilities (Claude Desktop):
- **Architecture Design**: High-level system design and component relationships
- **Intelligent Implementation**: Complex logic, algorithm design, data structures
- **Strategic Planning**: Feature roadmaps, technical decisions, requirement analysis
- **Contract Definition**: Define clear interfaces between components

### Copilot's Responsibilities:
- **Integration**: Connect components, manage seam communications
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing, validation, code review
- **Infrastructure**: Build tools, deployment, configuration management
- **Refinement**: Polish implementations, optimize performance

### Communication Guidelines:
- Use `message_type` to categorize: `task_assignment`, `status_update`, `question`, `delivery`, `review`
- Include `priority`: `high`, `medium`, `low`
- Always provide clear context and expected outcomes
- Reference specific files and line numbers when possible

## üéØ IMMEDIATE TASKS

### 1. Test the Communication Bridge
Use the `ai_communication_bridge` tool to:
- Read existing messages with `read_new`
- Send a test message confirming you're online
- Verify the collaboration system is working

### 2. Review Project State
Examine these key files to understand current implementation:
- `src/contracts.ts` - Understand existing contracts
- `src/seams.ts` - Review seam management
- `README.md` - Grasp SDD methodology
- `ai-collaboration/communication.jsonl` - See setup messages

### 3. Propose Next Phase Features
Based on SDD methodology, identify high-value AI features to implement:
- Advanced seam detection algorithms
- Automated contract generation from code analysis  
- Intelligent code pattern recognition
- Compliance validation systems
- Learning-based improvement suggestions

## üîó SDD METHODOLOGY PRINCIPLES

**"Seams First, Implementation Second"**

Always follow this workflow:
1. **Identify Seams** - What components need to communicate?
2. **Define Contracts** - What are the interfaces and data flows?
3. **Create Stubs** - Generate skeleton implementations
4. **Test Connections** - Validate seam communications work
5. **Implement** - Fill in actual logic

### Core Patterns:

**Contracts (Always Async)**:
```typescript
interface ComponentContract {
  method(input: InputType): Promise<ContractResult<OutputType>>;
}

type ContractResult<T> = {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
};
```

**Error Handling**:
```typescript
try {
  if (!input) return { success: false, error: "Invalid input - failing fast" };
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  return { success: false, error: error.message };
}
```

## üöÄ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Phase 1 (Immediate):
- [ ] Successfully test communication bridge
- [ ] Review and understand project architecture
- [ ] Propose 3-5 high-value AI features for implementation
- [ ] Establish clear task assignment workflow with Copilot

### Phase 2 (Implementation):
- [ ] Design and implement at least 2 advanced SDD features
- [ ] Maintain strict SDD compliance (contracts ‚Üí stubs ‚Üí implementation)
- [ ] Collaborate effectively using the bridge system
- [ ] Deliver working, tested features

## üìã FIRST ACTIONS CHECKLIST

1. **Test Bridge**: `ai_communication_bridge` with `read_new` operation
2. **Send Greeting**: Introduce yourself and confirm readiness
3. **Review Setup**: Read the communication.jsonl file to understand setup
4. **Explore Codebase**: Examine contracts.ts, seams.ts, and existing tools
5. **Propose Features**: Suggest next phase AI integration features
6. **Coordinate with Copilot**: Establish task assignment and workflow

## üé® COMMUNICATION TEMPLATE

When sending messages, use this structure:
```json
{
  "operation": "send_message",
  "message": "Your detailed message here",
  "sender": "claude_desktop", 
  "message_type": "task_assignment|status_update|question|delivery|review",
  "priority": "high|medium|low",
  "context": "Relevant file paths, line numbers, or component names",
  "expected_outcome": "What you expect from this communication"
}
```

**Ready to begin? Start by testing the communication bridge and introducing yourself to Copilot!**

The SDD MCP Server project is at an exciting inflection point - your architectural expertise combined with Copilot's integration skills will unlock the next level of AI-driven development tooling.

**Remember**: This is a Seam-Driven Development project, so we must eat our own dog food - always identify seams first, then implement!
